nam4j is a middleware based on the Networked Autonomic Machine (NAM) formalism, which allows to model a hardware/software system able to
  * communicate with other NAMs;
  * execute a number of functional modules that may provide/consume services or context events;
  * dynamically deploy, undeploy and migrate functional modules and services.


## News ##

April 2015: NAM4J has moved to **`GitHub`** **http://github.com/dsg-unipr/nam4j/**

March 2014: We have a new [DOWNLOADS](http://dsg.ce.unipr.it/?q=node/87) section. The reason is that the one provided by Google Code will be removed soon.

December 2013: NAM4J v0.2.0 released! See the Downloads section, and read the tutorial in the Wiki section. Enjoy!

November 2013: `ContextBus` class committed to svn! It implements the publish/subscribe mechanisms, for sharing context events within a set of functional modules of the same NAM (see the example in ..). We are currently working on a socket-based distributed version of the context bus. We are also fixing the code mobility part, towards next stable release of NAM4J.

June 2013: We are updating the source code, in order to refine migration mechanisms (including support for Android platform). We plan to release a stable jar soon. Meanwhile, you can checkout the current source tree and look at the wiki (where code examples are going to appear).

January 2013: We have updated the source code, including the mechanisms for migrating functional modules and services.

23 September 2011: We have released nam4j-0.1.0.jar. We are preparing a standalone demo (source code is already available in the svn - you need to import the whole trunk as Eclipse project).

15 September 2011: We have introduced task-related interfaces and classes. We plan to release a nam4j.jar v0.1.0 soon. Meanwhile, the demo is being updated.

12 August 2011: The first demo is complete! Read the tutorial in the Wiki section.
